1- constant complexity O(1)
  here no itration over the input regardless how many code line inside the funtion 

2- linear complexity O(n)
here there is iteration over input ex.array and make some functionality on each element

3- dublicate/sequare complexity O(n*n)
here we will find in the code nested itration over the input ex. two nested loop over array 
to do some thing 

4- O(log(n))
here we will find itaration over the input , but here we will iterate over spisific parte in
the input
