1. retrieve fxn: it is O(n) fxn, because it has a for loop related to the key length then it will do constanat steps.

2. sortedArrayContainsItem fxn: it is O(n) fxn, because it will have if statment for the elements and it has specific statment until it reach the answer (smaler for loop but we dont know its length)..

3. hasDuplicates fxn: it is O(n^2) fxn, because it has for loop and inside it we have indexof which also have for loop inside it.
