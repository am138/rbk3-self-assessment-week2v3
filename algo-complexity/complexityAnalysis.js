// List and briefly describe the types of algorithmic time complexity.
// Be as clear and complete as necessary to demonstrate your mastery.
// Write your explanation below as a comment
/*
1) constant complexity : describe the function which has no for loop or recursion for example returning single value
2) linear complexity (n) : describe the function which has just one for loop or recursion for example iterating over array in this case the complixity will depend on array size
3) log(n) complexity : for example iterating over binary tree.
4) square complexity (n^2) : for example : function that has two nested for loop.
