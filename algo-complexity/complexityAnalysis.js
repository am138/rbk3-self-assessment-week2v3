// List and briefly describe the types of algorithmic time complexity.
// Be as clear and complete as necessary to demonstrate your mastery.
// Write your explanation below as a comment
/*
1- constant O(1)
	spicefic steps, looping with specific and known steps
	for (var i=0; i<3; i++){} 
2-binary search O(log): when I go through a search but each time I remove the half of the choice
3- linear O(n)
	go throgh loop (for, while)
4- O(n^2)
	go through loop inside loop 
		for(){
			for(){}
		}
5- O(c^n)
