/*
O(1):
    the pest performance is when the complexity is O(1) which means that we only needed one operation to get the desired output, no looping or recursion.

O(n):
    it's more complex and it means that we needed to loop to get the desired putput, but not the looping happens to every element once only with each input.

O(log(n)):
    more complex than the previous two, it is like looping but not for the entire input, like the searching methods that divides a sorted input to a smaller parts and checks if the needed element is in one of them, if it's not found it'll be devided again after determining if the element is larger or smaller than the parts devided.
    
O(n^2):
    it is more complex than above, it means that the loopingn will happen number of times to every element in the input.
O(exponentails):
    more complex, lots of nested looping and recursion.
