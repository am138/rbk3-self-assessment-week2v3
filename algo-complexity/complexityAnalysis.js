O(1) when the program dont have any for loop or recarsive,
O(n) when program has loop in and itrate in unknown number,
O(n^2) when program has nested loop and itrate in unknown number,
O(n^3) when program has three loops and itrate in unknown number,
O(n^n) when program has n loops and itrate in unknown number,
O(log n) when program has loop and itrate in some element in array,
