Algorithmic time complexities from best to worst: 

  - Constant time complexity O(1): is the best case of time complexity that we can have,
  		where the process made by the process made by the code is the same regardless 
  		of the size of the input. (ex. returning first array element)

  - Logarithmic time complexity O(lg n): where the amount of work done by the program is in order of the logarithm 
		of the size of the input. (ex. binary search)

  - Polynomial time complexity O(n -linear- / n^2 -quadratic- / n^3 -cubic-... etc): where the amount of work done by the code is equal to 
  		the corresponding complexity function.(ex. bubble sort)

  - Exponential time complexity O(b^n) : where b is the base of the exponential expression. 
  		the amount of work done by the code is equal to the corresponding complexity function.

  - Factorial time complexity O(n!) : the amount of work done by the code is equal to the 
  		corresponding complexity function. (ex. n-rooks algorithm)
