// List and briefly describe the types of algorithmic time complexity.

// Write your explanation below as a comment
/*
	1-Constant: when you have a finite number of operations for example ,
	when you push element to array or adding two numbers.
	2-Big-O(n) "linear": when you have infinite(unknown) number of operation in 
	one layer for example , for loop for n array length.
	3-Big-O(n^2) "quadratic":  when you have infinite(unknown) number of operation in 
	two layer for example , two nested for loop for n array length.
	4-Big-O(log(n)) "logarathmic":when you have infinite(unknown) number of operation in 
	one layer but you ignore the half of n each time 
    for example , Binary search.
