 O(n): when the function need to itrate over all element 

 O(n^2): when the function need to itrate over all element more than one time 

 O(log(n)): when we have recursive function and the secound time we call the function we 
 don't need to itrate over all element it well be less every time more than before 

 O(1): we need spesific steps to complete the function we don't need go over the element
