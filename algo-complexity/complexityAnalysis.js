// List and briefly describe the types of algorithmic time complexity.
// Be as clear and complete as necessary to demonstrate your mastery.
// Write your explanation below as a comment
/*
constant time complexity : when we have a fixed size O(1).
linear time complexity : the worst-case is to is to inter the whole n-size O(n)
logarithmic : O(log n)
quadratic : O(n^2)
the worst one is O(n^n)
