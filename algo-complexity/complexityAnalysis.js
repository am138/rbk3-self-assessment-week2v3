/*
1- O(1): "Constant"
it's a constent time function that will perform in the same time no matter what the argument is, for example there's the Mathematical operations.

2- O(log(n)):
it's a function where it ignores a part of the input during its execution, for example binary search.

3- O(n): "Linear"
it's a function that will iterate through the whole input to do some functionality, for example the map function.

4- O(n2):
it's a function that contains a double staged loops inside each other. for example:
for (var i =0; i<arr.length; i++){
	for (var key in obj){}
}

5- O(e): "Exponintial"
it's a function that will increase it's run time dramatically depending on its input
