time complexity fill in the follwing orders: 

1. O(1)(pronounce big O one) --> the best case and what we are looking forward alaways.As example, find a value in Object,
lokking up a value of known index. Also, delete the head of linked list, also insert a node in double link list. 

2. O(n) --> not preferable like remove first element in array, find node in linked list. 

3. O(n^2) --> worst case like for loop inside for loop, insert element in in mid array index. 

time complexity does not give us accurate prediction but an estimation rather. 
4. O(log n) like binary search where time complexity increasing in time with decreasing rate.
