// List and briefly describe the types of algorithmic time complexity.
// Be as clear and complete as necessary to demonstrate your mastery.
// Write your explanation below as a comment
/*1) constant:running time of statement.
2) linear:running time of loop.
3) quadratic: running time of two loops./maybe it has one loop and built in loop inside it.
4)logarithmic: running time of loop but with if condition.
