// there is time complexity O(1) it is the better whay to do function and it is the smple whay to it comes
// with the ordenare function that don't tack and need a for loop.


//the other one is the O(n) it comes with the for loop and it is not the best whay to Write a function 

// and there is the O(n*n) it is a function contanes a tow for loops and the tow of them after each other (seperatly)
// and it is not a good whay to 


//and there is O(2n) it has tow for loop and the tow are conected to each other insid each other
