// List and briefly describe the types of algorithmic time complexity.
// Be as clear and complete as necessary to demonstrate your mastery.
// Write your explanation below as a comment
/*
1-the leaner complexity O(N):if we have N items as input we have to do n operations in worst case to get the result for example :
when we search about number in array;
2-constant or O(1):if we can got the result with one operation .example :when we lookup a item in the array and have the index of
that item 
3-O(n)^2 N square:when we have to do n^2 operation to get the result example bubble sort 
4-logaritmeic O(log2(n)):when we have to do log 2(n )operation to got the result example binary search in sorted array
5-exponetional O(2)^n which is the worst senario and consuming alot of time we have to avoid it
