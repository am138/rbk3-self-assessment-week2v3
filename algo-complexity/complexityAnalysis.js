// List and briefly describe the types of algorithmic time complexity.
// Be as clear and complete as necessary to demonstrate your mastery.
// Write your explanation below as a comment
/*
// 1- o(1) :
//constant time complexity/ shortest time and memory 

2 - o(n) :
liner time complexity / incresing with a constan value the best after the constant 

3 - o(logn):
Logarithm time complexity / has time complexity more than o(n) but still a good choice / example >> binary tree 

4 - o(n2):
its not prefer it take and memory and time as the input get bigger / example >> loop inside loop

5- o(n!)
huge time complexity with the input >>>> avoide it
