// List and briefly describe the types of algorithmic time complexity.

/*
[constant] : that's mean the growth for this function is fixd

[log(n)] : that's mean the growth for this function 
like binary search each time i just check a half of the array.

[n]  : that's mean the growth for this function is liner.

[n^2] : that's mean the growth for this function is so fast by the time.
