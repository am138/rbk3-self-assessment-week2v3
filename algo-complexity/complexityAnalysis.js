constant complexity withe equal O(1) it is for simple equajen or seclarate variable EX: var x, x=6+8
liniar   complexity withe equal O(n) its for for lob statment EX: for (var i = 0; i < Things.length; i++) {}
quadratic complexity withe equal O log(n) for instans for loop 
the fourth one when we have a multiple thing like loops and recargen
