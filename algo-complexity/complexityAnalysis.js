// List and briefly describe the types of algorithmic time complexity.
// Be as clear and complete as necessary to demonstrate your mastery.
// Write your explanation below as a comment
/*linear time complexity is the one time processe that it is the shotest and simplest algrithimic type n(1)
big o time complexity is a more complicated and longer process 
 another type which is the meduime that comes between the linear and the big o
