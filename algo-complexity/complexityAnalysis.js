/*
1- O(1): it's the time complexity for operations that consume a fixed amount of time no matter what that size of input is, e.g. var x = 0;
2- O( log(n) ): it's the time complexity for searching through a sorted binary tree.
3- O(n): also called linear time complexity, time of execution depends on the input size and grows linearly with it, e.g. simple array search algorithm
4- O(n^c): its time complexity grows n^c times depending on the input size, e.g. sorting algorithms
5- O(2^n): exponential time complexity, the worst of all time complexity. It's time doubdles with each new input, e.g. dictionary attack algorithms
