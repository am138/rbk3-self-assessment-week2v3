/* there are four type of algorithmic time complexity 

1- constant (O(1)) : it's an operation takes constant time to make access 
to specific operation like an object ;

2- linear (O(n)) : it's an operation takes linear time (the time is increasing by fixed value) to make access 
to specific operation like a for loop itirate over array;

3- quadratic (O(n^2)) : it's an operation takes quadratic time (the time is increasing dubuled ) to make access 
to specific operation like a for loop itirate over array; 


3- quadratic (O(n^n)) : it's an operation takes a (n) time (the time is increasing by n with time ) to make access 
to specific operation;
