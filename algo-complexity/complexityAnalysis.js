// List and briefly describe the types of algorithmic time complexity.
// Be as clear and complete as necessary to demonstrate your mastery.

/*
	1- Constant: we need only one instruction to complete the algorethim.
	2- Logarithim: we check half of the array each loop, so no need to loop all elements.
	3- Linear: we need n instructions to complete, we need loop to loop all elements to apply the instruction on.
	4- Quadratic (O(n^2)): we need to repeat the repeated instruction squared time, nested loops.
